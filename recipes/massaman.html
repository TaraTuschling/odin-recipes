<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Massaman is a rich curry sauce originating in Thailand. This recipe is for beef massaman, but this curry can also be made with chicken or tofu.</p>
<p>Best served with sticky rice and mountains of fresh coriander, massaman contains meat or tofu, potatoes, and rich, warm spices such as cinnamon. We'll be using store-bought paste, because we are not in fact experienced Thai grandmothers.</p>

<li>800g-1kg of shin beef</li>
<li>1 jar of massaman paste</li>
<li>A couple of inches of fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
<li>Four cloves of garlic</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups of beef stock</li>
<li>Three medium-large potatoes</li>
<li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
<li>Rice, fresh coriander, and chopped peanuts to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>

<li>This is where I will describe the steps necessary for cooking this delicious meal.</li>
<li>As we explored on the lasagne page, I am currently learning to use HTML, not perfecting my recipe writing skills.</li>
<li>So here you go:</li>
<li>Cook the curry and eat it with your loved ones.</li>
