    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagne is a layered pasta dish originating in Italy.</p>
    <p>Layers of a beef mince sauce are alternated with layers of flat sheet pasta, topped with bechamel sauce.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <h4>Beef sauce/filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
       <li>500g pork mince</li>
       <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li> 
       <li>1/2 cup beef stock</li>
       <li>30g tomato paste</li>
       <li>1 green onion</li>
       <li>1 carrot</li>
       <li>1 stick celery</li>
       <li>500 cloves of garlic</li>
       <li>1 generous splash of red wine</li>
       <li>500g mushrooms</li>
       <li>Family box of pasta sheets</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h4>Bechamel sauce</h4>
   
    <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Nutmeg</li>
    <li>Grated cheese to top, preferably a combo of cheddar and parmesan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 celsius.</li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan or ceramic pot, as per your preference for meat sauces.</li>
        <li>Finely chop onion, celery and carrot and fry together until soft to make a soffrito.</li>
        <li>Once softened, add chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant; then add beef and pork mince and brown.</li>
        <li>Once browned, season well, then add tomatoes, stock, wine, and mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Simmer for approx 20-30 mins. Do not reduce too far; you need the fluid to cook the pasta. Not too dry, not too wet. You get a feel for it.</li>
        <li>Layer sauce and pasta sheets in a large baking dish. Aim for at least two layers of each. Do not add top layer of pasta sheets yet; if they sit on top of the meat sauce while you cook the bechamel, they will curl up in the heat.</li>
        <li>Now make the bechamel sauce. This involves making a roux and then adding fluid. This is a website building exercise, and I can't be bothered typing out all the instructions for making a white sauce right now. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+bechamel+sauce&oq=how+to+make+bechamel&aqs=chrome.0.35i39j69i57j0i67l2j0i20i263i512j0i512l5.2907j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Google</a> it.</li>
        <li>Once you've made the bechamel sauce, chuck the final layer of pasta on top of the baking dish, pour the white sauce on there, smooth it out, top it with cheese, and bang the the whole thing in the oven for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Nine steps is a weird number for the list, so remove that bad boy from the oven and eat it with your loved ones.</li>
    </ol>
