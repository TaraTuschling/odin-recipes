    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I've been making this soup for my friends as the weather gets colder for a couple of years.</p>
    <p>Serve with crusty bread if your friends can digest gluten.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 large green onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 stick celery</li>
<li>1 litre vegetable stock</li>
<li>Vegetables as available: broccoli, kumara, potatoes, leek</li>
<li>1 piece danish blue cheese</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Chop all vegetables; soffrito veggies finely, others less so to save time.</li>
<li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pot and cook soffrito until very soft, without browning too much. Approx 10 mins.</li>
<li>Once soffrito is soft, add other chopped vegetables and stock.</li>
<li>Simmer without boiling for as long as it takes to cook vegetables.</li>
<li>Remove from heat. Add roughly chopped blue cheese. Mash with potato masher/blend with stick blender.</li>

    </ol>
